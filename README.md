# People in Space
Display names of astronauts currently in space.
	- fetch data from http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json
	- grouped by spacecraft where they are
	- sorted by last name

This is my solution to the exercise 47, "Who's in Space?", from the book _Exercises for Programmers_ by Brain P. Hogan.
